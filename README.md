-  Disguising of all StealthCom packets as 802.11 probe requests
-  Wireless communication without the use of an AP allowed by raw packet injection and packet capture

StealthCom uses a simple and easy to use command based user interface. This program can be used on any Linux based device that has a network interface capable of monitor mode and raw packet injection

Start the program using "sudo ./StealthCom \<wlan interface\>"
